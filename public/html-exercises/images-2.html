        <h1>Journey</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="images/babypic.jpg" alt="I'm fat!!!!!" width="200px" height="150px"/></a><br></br>When I was a child, all I do was eat; thus, explains the Michellin like figure. Hahaha. I also loved sleeping.<br></br>
            I was pretty much a big snooze ball as a kid. I also loved watching cartoons such as Little Bill and Powerpuff Girls.<br></br>
            Coloring boooks were pretty much my thing back then, too. The sad thing is that my parents were pretty strict; <br></br>
            thus, explains my lack of knowhow on riding a bike.<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            
            <a href="text-formatting-1.html"><img src="images/HS.jpg" alt="High School <3" width="200px" height="150px"/></a><br></br>
            High school is pretty much one of the best years of my entire life. Attending an all girls school gave me my much needed freedom.<br></br>
            It was truly liberating to do whatever you want inside those halls because you could relate to one another - without a man dragging you down. (Kidding. Haha.)<br></br>
            High school's where I found my friends, honed my skills, developed my personality and lived life.<br></br>
            I wouldn't trade my little pseudo convent of a school for any grand high school experience.<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            
            <a href="images-1.html"><img src="images/recent.jpg" alt="Yay, college-self <3" width="200px" height="250px"/></a><br></br>
            There were a few bumps on the road but those little setbacks made me who I am today.<br></br>
            From surpassing the dreaded Math 17 New Freshman course to the selection of what supposedly could be my <br></br>
            thesis topic for my senior year - everything about this journey is both excruciating and beautiful<br></br>
            My current life is what I consider to be the turning point of my life - I am no longer a child nor am I really an adult.<br></br>
            Tho, I could attest to the fact that I am now mature - all the experiences I've had in this university has honed me to be better.<br></br>
            
             <br></br>
            
            <a href="http://www.google.com/"><img src="images/lawyer.jpg" alt="Life Goals!" width="200px" height="150px"/></a><br></br>
            The main reason as to why I chose Economics as my undergraduate degree is due to the fact that I would like to become a lawyer in the near future.<br></br>
            My love for TV series has made Scottie from Suits my life peg.<br></br>
            She is a Harvard Law graduate and is working at one of the top law firms in New York.<br></br>
            As for my goal, I am hoping to land in a spot at one of the top law schools in the Philippines - may it be UP, Ateneo or San Benda.<br></br>
            Hopefully, I only have 1 year left here in LB and could pursue my dreams. <br></br>

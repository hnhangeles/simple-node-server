        <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em>
        </br>
        <br>
        The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oiY7W7nDeE"> My Blue Valentine </a>.
        This movie is one for the books because it is interestingly styled and shot. 
        It features outstanding performances from Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams and an inventive screenplay and structure.
        </br>
        <br>
        The second spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZdl2FFp0eA"> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>.
        This film is absolutely stunning. Works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped 
        inside one's own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart. 
        At its core, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind could have been just another love story. 
        Refracted through Kaufman's wonderfully weird prism, it's something truly memorable
        </br>
        <br>
        The top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQoH1IGRB3w">Celeste and Jesse Forever</a>.
        This movie has quite a differemt tune to it; thus, my great admiration to it. With its refusal to follow the 
        usual romantic-comedy formula, this snappy and observant movie is a nice surprise. 
        There is quiet, seditious verve to the way expectations are derailed and then re-railed, just as in those 
        areas of real life that still exist even outside the expanding Sundance empire of middlebrow observationalism.

        <em>The Top 3 Songs of My Playlist</em>
        <br></br>
        <br>
        The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu9-5SS8V8M&index=6&list=RDEMY47nlWkVWlQp5gibTDjcYg"> If I Die Young</a>.
        This song never fails to give me goosebumps. It reminds me of how our lives could go by in just an instant.
        Thus, to live a life of great adventure is what the song tries to convey. Indeed, beautiful.
        </br>
        <br>
        The second spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzARx0EuDgc"> See You Again/Love Me Like You Do/Sugar</a>.
        This is actually an acoustic mash-up of three songs. I love YouTube covers and this is just absolutely stunning.
        I love how the YouTube artists were able to blend the three songs in such a way that not one song overpowers the other.
        It takes great talent to do that; thus, kudos to this awesome cover!
        </br>
        <br>
        The top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlQrKO9o2ko">Blank Space/Jealous</a>.
        Another mash-up takes the top spot - granted that I love two of these songs seperatley, it just gave me utmost
        happiness that these songs were able to come together beautifully. Also, plus points because I absolutely
        adore both Taylor Swift and Nick Jonas!

            I had my primary and intermediate education at <abbr title="Colegio de Sta. Rosa">CSR</abbr> Makati - an exclusive school for girls. I am currently an undergraduate
            student at <abbr title="University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr>. My favorite books vary from cynical, twistted and dark children series such as 
            <cite>A Series of Unfortunate Events</cite> by Lemony Snicket and to light-hearted coming of age stories such as <cite>Looking For Alaska</cite> by John Green.
            In school, a famous quotation that got to me is, <q>Rest if you must but don't you quit.</q>
